1.Make_ref.py to make reference sequences of all shRNA variants in high-throughput cleavage assays.
2.calculate_cleavage_efficiency_accuracy.py to calculate the accuracy and efficiency of DICER cleavages on shRNA variants. Input files were obtained from the processing and mapping of sequencing reads.
3.calculating_variability_in_start_position.py to calculate the variability of the 5p-end of 3p-miRNA in small RNA sequencing libraries.
4.Base_pair_enrichment.py to calculate the enrichment of each position in the DRES and YCR motif. The code utilizes Logomaker package.
